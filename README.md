# ClickCounter
A simple click counter using JS

Todo
1) add a reset button
2) Add logic to not let the counter go below 0, and display a message to the user that a number below 0 isn't allowed
3) Build a toggle button to "allow numbers below 0, deny numbers below 0"
4) Build a drop down that allows the user to increment the counter by 1, 2, or 3 digits at a time
